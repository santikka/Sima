Description: Provides a simulation framework for large-scale individual 
    level data generationn. The simulators created under the framework are event 
    based and follow a fixed-increment time progression. The initial population 
    is modified by events that are applied at each time increment. A simulator 
    can be calibrated according to chosen measures of similarity with the use of 
    external validation data. Parallel computation can be used with 
    foreach-backends such as doMPI and doParallel.
